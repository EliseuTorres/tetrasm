# Tetrasm

Tetris for x86 in NASM.

Mostly a port from C of
[Bare Metal Tetris](https://github.com/programble/bare-metal-tetris).

## Build

```
make
```

For now this will only work on x86 or x86_64 machines, since it does not
attempt to use a cross-compiler.

The output is a multiboot ELF file `tetrasm.elf`.

## Emulate

```
make qemu
```
